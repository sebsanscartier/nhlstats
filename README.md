# nhlstats
This web application was built for a class project.

It's a great way to have a basic visualisation of NHL team ranking.
You can search and sort by any field available on the table.

To update the stats you need to run the test.py file.

The various technologies/ libraries I used for the project are : JQuery, Bootstrap, Python3, HTML5.

Also the api source is included in the .html file.
